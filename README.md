# Technical Report: Minimalist Formula 1 API with Node.js and Fastify

## Introduction:
This report describes the creation of a minimalist Formula 1 API using Node.js with the Fastify framework, implemented in TypeScript. The main goal of the project was to develop a lightweight and efficient API, focused on basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing Formula 1 drivers' data.

## Objectives:
- Create a RESTful API for managing Formula 1 drivers.
- Implement endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the drivers' data.
- Utilize the Fastify framework for high performance and low latency.
- Integrate CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support to allow requests from different origins.
- Document the API using Swagger to facilitate understanding and usage by developers.

## Methodology:
1. **Environment Setup:** We initialized a new Node.js project, configured the development environment, and installed the necessary dependencies, including Fastify and its extensions for CORS and Swagger documentation.
2. **Endpoint Implementation:** We defined API routes for manipulating drivers' data, including operations to list all drivers, add a new driver, update existing driver data, and delete a driver.
3. **Data Model Definition:** We created a TypeScript interface to represent the data model of drivers, including attributes such as ID, name, team, country, and number of wins.
4. **API Documentation:** We used the Fastify Swagger plugin to automatically generate API documentation, making it easy to understand the available endpoints, their parameters, and responses.
5. **Testing and Execution:** We tested the API endpoints to ensure their correct operation and executed the application to make it available for use.

## Results:
- A functional and efficient API was developed for managing Formula 1 drivers' data.
- CRUD endpoints were successfully implemented and tested, allowing easy and secure data manipulation.
- CORS support was integrated, allowing the API to be accessed from different origins securely.
- API documentation was automatically generated by Fastify Swagger, providing a clear and comprehensive reference for developers wishing to use the API.

## Conclusion:
The project achieved its objectives by developing a minimalist Formula 1 API with Node.js and Fastify. The implementation of CRUD endpoints, CORS support, and API documentation ensure that the application is easy to understand, use, and integrate into different projects. This project serves as a solid foundation for future expansions and improvements to the API.
